Three groundtruth files are included as follows:

1 NASA_GTF.txt Partial labeling of craters (in the size range 20-200 pixels in diameter) by NASA citizen scientists.
	Each line starts with an image name followed by the total number labeled craters, followed by the x and y coordinates of the top left and bottom right points of the box cotaining each crater
	groundtruths are seperated by '2's!!!

2 StudentsLabels.txt Partial labeling of craters (greater than 10 pixels in diameter) by UNR students.
	Each line starts with an image name followed by the total number labeled craters, followed by the coordinates of each crater as "x  y  width  height"
3 StudentsLabelsUnsure.txt Partial labeling of POSSIBLE craters locations by UNR students.
	Format similar to 2.

NOTE: It is strongly recommended to confirm all groundtruth by planetary scientists, although we have tried to be as acurate as possible!
